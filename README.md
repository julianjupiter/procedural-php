# Procedural PHP
This example is an example of PHP application in procedural approach. There is no single class. It uses PDO MySQL (hmmm, it's still OOP ;-)). For the client-side, it uses jQuery and Bootstrap 3.3.7 and uses Fetch API, instead of AJAX.

# How To Run
Clone:
Linux
```
$ git clone https://github.com/julianjupiter/procedural-php.git
```
Windows
```
> git clone https://github.com/julianjupiter/procedural-php.git
```
Or download and extract the zipped file.

Go to the directory:
Linux
```
$ cd procedural-php
```
Windows
```
> cd procedural-php
```
Execute:
Linux
```
$ ./bin/start.sh
```
Windows
```
$ .\bin\start.bat
```
Note: On Windows, make sure the php.exe is added to Environment Variables's Path. See my [tutorial](http://julianjupiter.github.io/blog/installation-of-php-7-on-windows-10/).
